# Nightstand

## Intro Screen Branch

The Intro Screen Branch is committed to *alpha* development of the setup display of Nightstand.

---

Nightstand is an iOS app, build with Xcode, which aims to create an Apple Watch-like interface for nighttime use.

The app *should* be able to keep the device awake throughout the night to serve as a large clock display. 
Additionally, at a user-defined time, the app will play an alarm sound. 

When the user responds to this alarm, 
the app will display the current weather for the user's location and, taking wind, clouds, and precipitation
into account, will recommend clothing and travel options for the user.

More content will be added in the future.
